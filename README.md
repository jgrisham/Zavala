# Zavala

A dedicated outliner for macOS, iPadOS, and iOS.

## Notes about this specific fork
This is here to see what would have to be done to make this compatible with macOS 10.15 Catalina, OS X 10.9 Mavericks, or even Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.

If Chromium-Legacy can do it, then so can I!

Current status:
* No work has been done towards this goal, as of March 2024.

Notes:
* For reference, version 1.0.1 was [listed in the Mac App Store as requiring iOS 14 / macOS 11](http://web.archive.org/web/20210702190114/https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zavala/id1546457750).

## Download

Zavala 2.0 has been released! You can [download it in the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zavala/id1546457750).

## Community

Let's talk outliners! Head over to [Discussions](https://github.com/vincode-io/Zavala/discussions) for outliner discussion and to express what you would like to see in an outliner application. Be sure to read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/vincode-io/Zavala/wiki/Code-of-Conduct).

## User Contributions

We are looking for active user contributors.  We need people to test the application and provide feedback, including your
ideas about what you would like to see in an outliner.  If you find a bug and it isn't already in 
[Issues](https://github.com/vincode-io/Zavala/issues), you can add it there.  If you have an idea you would like see implemented,
bring it up in [Discussions](https://github.com/vincode-io/Zavala/discussions).

This is your chance to help shape what Zavala will become but, we aren't looking to build an outliner by committee.  Not all features
can be implemented due to time constraints. Some features can't be implemented because they conflict with other ones.  We also
have specific [Design Goals](https://github.com/vincode-io/Zavala/wiki/Design-Goals).  All input is welcome, but the primary
project contributors have final say in the design.

## Code Contributions

We welcome contributions!

If you’d like to contribute:

1. File a ticket describing the bug you want to fix or feature you want to add. Or find an existing ticket.
2. In [Discussions](https://github.com/vincode-io/Zavala/discussions) under the [Work](https://github.com/vincode-io/Zavala/discussions/categories/work) category mention that you would like to work on the item. We will probably discuss implementation details.  **This is very important, because there might be things you need to know before you start work.**
4. Once approved, then go for it. Write the code, then do a pull request. We’ll either have comments or we’ll merge it. (We might revise it afterward, of course.)

## Credits

I would like to thank [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net) and [Brent Simmons](https://inessential.com)
for inspiring this project. Their dedication to outliners and disatisfaction with the current generation of
them is ultimately what got this project going.  In fact John [tweeted](https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1277329886080905219) this:

> I would kill for a good simple outliner that synced across iOS and Mac, and had a great *simple* UI on all three platforms.

If there was a mission statement for Zavala, that would be it.
